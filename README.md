# Instructions

This is your source project. Source Only. You will copy and paste from here!

Yup, we are going to copy and paste.

Use `npx create-react-app week-11-react-calc-app` to create your own project.

Cd into `week-11-react-calc-app` and copy each of the Components from this source project into new module files of their own in your app. This makes your app way better than the source app.

Step by step. Test the app in the browser often to make sure we don't have too many broken items.
